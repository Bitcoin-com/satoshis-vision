    "quote": "The question is: Which coin wins in the end in terms of market adoption, and by inference, market value over the next 12–24 months. If it’s based on the current network effect, Bitcoin will win hands down. If Bitcoin Cash’s philosophy proves to be superior and it can build a bigger network by attracting the businesses than can no longer run on Bitcoin due to high fees, even while sacrificing some areas of centralization, then it has a chance of building the bigger network effect and having a higher coin price as a result.<br><br>The gold market (Store of Value) is estimated at $7 trillion and the currency market (Medium of Exchange) is over $100 trillion. Both Bitcoin Cash & Bitcoin want to rule both."
