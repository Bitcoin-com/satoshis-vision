    "quote": "The gold market (Store of Value) is estimated at $7 trillion and the currency market (Medium of Exchange) is over $100 trillion. Both Bitcoin Cash & Bitcoin want to rule both. The question is how and in what context can both co-exist, as the crypto market will not benefit from a zero-sum game here, but rather from a win-win scenario, where both coins will find their ideal use case and scale massively."
