          <h4>Stay connected</h4>
          <p>Public WiFi can be hard to find in Tokyo, so consider purchasing a <b>SIM card</b> at the airport. You'll need an unlocked device. Or alternatively you can <b>rent a portalable wifi from the Airport</b> to connect multiple devices. Google Maps does a good job with subways and trains, but a good connection is key to making the most of your trip to Tokyo.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h4>Transit Card</h4>
          <p>Save yourself the headache of purchasing a ticket for each journey on the train. Pay 500 Yen ($5usd) for a <b>Passmo card</b> or <b>Suica card</b> and just load it up with some money. It's much easier to just scan yourself in than deal with tickets. Watch the gate scanner for your remaining amount to know when you'll need to top up again. You can purchase cards and top up from just about any ticket machine with the Passmo or Suica logo.</p>

        <div class="callout secondary">
          <h4>Language</h4>
          <p>Public transit is setup primarily in Japanese and English. Some stations include Korean, and Mandarin. Japanese people are very accepting of foreigners, and will do everything they can to try to understand. Google translate can be helpful during your travels. We recommend learning some phrases and greetings to help you get by. </p>

          <h4>Walking Shoes</h4>
          <p>If you plan on exploring Tokyo during your trip, make sure you bring a good pair of walking shoes. Despite the easy to use public transit system, it's not unheard of for tourists to put on 15,000-25,000 steps in a day.</p>
