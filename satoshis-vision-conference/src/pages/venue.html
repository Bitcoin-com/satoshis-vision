      <p>The venue is located in the Chiyoda district, next to the Imperial Palace Gardens.<br />
Chiyoda is often called the "political center" of Japan and with the seat of the Emperor in the Imperial Palace at its center, many government institutions are also located in the area, as are Tokyo landmarks such as Yasukuni Shrine. </p>
<p>Akihabara, a district known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping heaven for technology goods, is also part of Chiyoda.</p>
